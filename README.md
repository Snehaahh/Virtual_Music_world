### Project Description
Our project allows users to play musical instruments virtually using hand gestures detected via a webcam. No physical instruments or keyboard keys are requiredâ€”just move your hands in the air to create music!

### The Problem Statement
What if you could play musical instruments without owning them? Traditional instruments are expensive, require physical space, and canâ€™t be carried everywhere. Plus, accessibility for people with disabilities is limited.

### The Solution
We created a virtual instrument-playing platform where users can play different musical instruments in the air using hand gestures. Our web-based solution uses a webcam to detect hand movements and map them to instrument sounds.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Frameworks: Flask (for backend), React (for frontend)
- Libraries: OpenCV, Mediapipe (for hand tracking), TensorFlow (for model processing), Tone.js (for audio processing)
